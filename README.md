# LilyDiscordBot

I recently made a wonderful friend via a chance League of Legends encounter, and we began chatting over discord.
After spending some time with them and their friends I quickly found out this friend refused to use the voice channel because
they were unable to speak to begin with (read as: a mute). This is troublesome because when you're in a voice channel on discord,
many messages in plaintext are simply overlooked. So I decided I would make this person a bot (affectionality called Lily) which
automatically joins any voice channel a specified user is in, and will orate anything the user types in a general text channel.

So I did just that with discord.py, and Google Cloud's API.

One of the main goals here is to improve the quality of life, so convenience is a huge deal. Since said friend already communicates
in our discord server by typing in the general chat, he/she literally doesn't have to do anything else but continue what they originally did.

In addition, I wanted to add a variety of voices with different genders to accomodate both my nonbinary friend, as well as anyone
who decides to use this. Therefore, I retrieved Google's list of various voices and allowed the user to choose whichever one they liked.

Feel free to message me if you're interested in this bot and/or want to see more features!
