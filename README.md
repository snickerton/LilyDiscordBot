# LilyDiscordBot

I recently made a wonderful friend via a chance League of Legends encounter, and we connected/messaged over discord.
After spending some time with them and their friends I quickly found out this friend never used the server's voice channel because
they were unable to speak (read as: a mute). This is troublesome because when you're in a discord voice channel,
many messages in plain text are simply overlooked. 

Of course, the most natural thing anyone would do here is program a discord bot in python with Google's text to speech API, so that's what happened.

I made this person a bot (affectionality called Lily) which automatically joins any voice channel a specified user is in, and will orate anything the user types in a general text channel.

The main goal here is to improve ease of communication, so convenience is a huge deal. Since said friend already communicates
in our discord server by typing in the general chat, he/she literally doesn't have to do anything else but continue doing what they originally did (is that proper grammar? should I have not pulled an allnighter doing this?).

In addition, I wanted to add a variety of voices with different genders to accomodate both my nonbinary friend, as well as anyone
who decides to use this. Therefore, I retrieved Google's list of various voices and allowed the user to choose whichever one they liked.

Feel free to message me if you're interested in this bot and/or want to see more features!
